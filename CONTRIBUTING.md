# Contributors Guide
Welcome to the Duguetia contributors guide! Merci for considering contributing to this repository. We really appreciate all the contributors who try to make this space better. This serves as a guide that will show you the path of least resistance for making valuable contributions to this project. Reading and following this guide shows that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this space. In return, they will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. This is the only way we can produce anything of value.


## Getting Started

- Have you read our [README](https://github.com/AlexVCS/Duguetia/blob/main/README.md)?
- Setup the project on your machine with the steps provided in the README

Most of the documentation is currently written using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to make it easy to add, modify, and edit what we need to.

We try not to take anything for granted, but in case we miss something, please reach out and let us know!

We really want to make space for all developers to feel comfortable and supported while contributing, and documentation like this provide a valuable resource for them to use.
