<p>The creators of HBO’s <em>Silicon Valley</em> could have glossed over the breakthrough technology behind fictional start-up Pied Piper, but instead they reached out to a Stanford professor for some help crafting a compression algorithm that seemed perfectly plausible on the surface. Ultimately, Ph.D student Vinith Misra was brought in to work on the nitty-gritty details of the algorithm. Beyond the original algorithm in the show, Misra also had to come up with the “breakthrough” discovery for the punchline of season finale. <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/software/a-madefortv-compression-algorithm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>IEEE Spectrum</em> has the full story</a>, and be sure to check out Misra’s complete — and hilarious — <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdoc%2F228831637%2FOptimal-Tip-to-Tip-Efficiency&referrer=theverge.com&xcust=___vg__p_5703742__t_w__d_D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">12-page</a> analysis called “Optimal Tip-to-Tip Efficiency: A Model for Male Audience Stimulation.”</p>`;

<p>When HBO rolled out a TV series poking fun at high tech this spring, Silicon Valley checked it out.</p>
<p>Initially, its namesake geeks and nerds who spend their days coding, developing and hacking in a red hot tech economy weren’t so sure it was funny: “Most startups are a soap opera, but not that kind of soap opera,” said Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of the valley’s most charismatic billionaires, after a premiere.</p>
<p>But many were amused enough by the warped story of their lives to keep watching, and soon some of the biggest names in the Silicon Valley were singing its praise on the region’s virtual water coolers.</p>
<p>There were even cameos from locals, including Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt. And, for a day, entrepreneur-investor Marc Andreeson tweeted lines from the show like “I truly believe we can only achieve greatness… if first, we achieve goodness.”</p>
<p>Now, with the final episode airing Sunday night, “Silicon Valley” has been upped for a second season — good news for local techies who gather en masse to watch five of their doppelgangers awkwardly talk to women, seek venture capital and try to launch a startup called Pied Piper, complete with its own mock website.</p>
<p>Creator Mike Judge (“Beavis and Butt-Head”), who collaborates as executive producer, writer and director with Alec Berg, taps into his own experience as a Silicon Valley engineer decades ago to nail the authenticity of this funny and sometimes painfully real, show.</p>
<p>“I live it every week,” said Silicon Valley venture capitalist Barry Schuler, former CEO of America Online. “We cannot take ourselves too seriously.</p>
<p>Shuler says the socially awkward characters — who wince and blink nervously, get bullied by adolescents, have trouble talking to women and taunt each other awkwardly — are a fair parody of his tech community.</p>
<p>“We don’t fit into normal social circles, you know what I mean? What we do is clearly done by a self-selecting group of people who like to sit in dark rooms and write code and make the world a better place,” he said.</p>
<p>Much of the show is tied to reality.</p>
<p>A socially awkward coder, played by Thomas Middleditch, turns down a $10 million acquisition offer and instead takes $200,000 in seed money to launch his own disruptive startup file compressor service. Then he vomits.</p>
<p>While there was no public angst when CEOs at firms including Snapchat, Fire Eye and Groupon turned down more than $1 billion offers in recent years, it’s reasonable to suspect someone’s stomach was turning. “That was such a send up on what happens when big guys start bidding, really inside baseball,” said Schuler.</p>
<p>Former stand-up comic Middleditch, who’s getting his big break on the show, says he had plenty of inner geek to pull off an authentic introverted Richard, a brilliant, panic-attack prone coder.</p>
<p>“There isn’t a huge difference between me and the character,” said the Canadian native. “I’m like normally nowadays a pretty chill guy but I’ve definitely had my bouts of not being the coolest kid on the block, not being able to talk to certain people, into various nerdy things.”</p>
<p>An avid gamer, Middleditch says it’s gratifying to be appreciated in the birthplace of Google, Apple and Facebook. “As much as we want to appeal to everyone, I think we would consider it a fail if we alienated Silicon Valley,” he said.</p>
<p>Not at all. About 1.7 million viewers tune in each week, according to Nielsen ratings, many from the innovative and wealthy center of tech.</p>
<p>“I have this interesting love-hate relationship with the show, because I watch television to escape from my everyday life, and this is like watching my everyday life,” but it’s slightly over the top. And I do say slightly,” said Jen Donahoe, who works at Mountain View, California, messaging app firm Tango. “We are ridiculous here. We are throwing crazy money at 20-somethings because they can write code. But these guys are big kids. They’re brilliant and geniuses but they play foosball and make fart jokes.”</p>
<p>Devon Crews, head of marketing for Santa Clara, California-based Citrix Startup Accelerator, which invests in early-stage companies, doesn’t miss an episode. And he says other entrepreneurs in the accelerator are watching, too. “Some love it. Some love to hate it, but everyone agrees that it is LOL funny,” said Crews.</p>
<p>The show has also attracted far flung Silicon Valley wannabes, uniting techies around the world who tweet their favorite lines to each other while they watch.</p>
<p>“All those geeky acts in a place that is like a wonderland for me, Silicon Valley, is just the thing I want to watch in a comedy,” said computer scientist Arash Pourhabibi Zarandi via email from Shiraz, Iran.</p>`;

<p>Bits and pieces of Disrupt can be seen in the behind the scenes video embedded here.</p>
<p>A source familiar with the show tells me the last two episodes revolve around the show’s startup, Pied Piper, competing in Disrupt SF. Apparently they make it to the finals since he tells me they pitch twice. Even better, Jason Kincaid plays himself during these scenes.</p>
<p>It’s true Mike Judge’s team attended Disrupt SF last year. They wanted to see first hand how startups operate and the pains they go through to pitch their life’s work to thousands of people.</p>
<p><em>Silicon Valley</em> premieres on HBO on April 6th and the show’s Tumblr, which will probably be packed with taglines from the characters, launches on March 24.</p>`;

<p>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, HBO should perhaps be blushing.</p>
<p>That’s because scammers are using domains for the fictional tech companies <a href="http://www.piedpiper.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pied Piper</a> and <a href="http://hooli.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hooli</a> from HBO’s Silicon Valley to try to trick unsuspecting consumers.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.valimail.com/the-only-email-authentication-solution-trusted-by-both-hooli-and-pied-piper" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a blog post</a>, email authentication firm ValiMail said Pied Piper and Hooli “have become well-known and highly recognized tech brands” as a result of the series and the network has created real websites for these fictional entities.</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a surprise-and-delight content marketing effort for Silicon Valley fans, but has prompted phishers to abuse the domains. ValiMail said it started monitoring said domains last month and has since detected thousands of messages from phishers that appear to be sent from Hooli and Pied Piper domains.</p>
<p>“Believe it or not, there are scammers out there trying to use Hooli.com and PiedPiper.com email addresses in the From fields of their fraudulent messages,” wrote chief technology officer Peter Goldstein. “After all, who could resist an offer from Gavin Belson (<a href="mailto:gavin.belson@hooli.com">gavin.belson@hooli.com</a>) for free tickets to Hoolicon? Or a free e-book on the Conjoined Triangles of Success from Action Jack Barker (<a href="mailto:action.jack@hooli.xyz">action.jack@hooli.xyz</a>)? Wouldn’t you click on a link or sign up for an account, if only to see what happens next?”</p>
<p>Goldstein also said ValiMail is now protecting these domains, so only messages sent by HBO on behalf of the fictional entities will be delivered.</p>`;

<p><a href="https://www.gunder.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gunderson Dettmer</a> is the law firm a good majority of tech startups turn to in the Valley for fundings, mergers, licensing and other deals, and it’s been in the business of offering every-day legal advice to everyone from Oracle to DoorDash since the dot-com boom. It was ranked the “most active law firm globally” in PitchBook’s recently released first quarter <a href="http://files.pitchbook.com/pdf/PitchBook_1Q_2017_Global_League_Tables.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2017 Global Venture Capital League Tables</a> and closed more than 1, 200 VC financing deals last year — so what advice does it have for Richard Hendricks’ character in HBO’s Silicon Valley?</p>
<p>I don’t want to give away any spoilers for those who haven’t watched the latest episode, but I did sit down with Gunderson partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivangaviria/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ivan Gavira</a> to get his take on the Pied Piper saga, his craziest deal and why Silicon Valley continues to turn to him for tech legalese.</p>
<p>IG: The way we look at the world is startups are about money, people and ideas and we do all of those things. The whole firm was built from the ground up with the sole goal of being the employer of choice for high-growth, venture-backed technology companies.</p>
<p>SB: <em>At what stage do you get involved? You have some pretty high-profile companies you work with.</em></p>
<p>IG: That’s what you see in the news. You see the DoorDashes, the Palantirs, the Warby Parkers and what-not because they have name recognition. But we actually start with companies at the very beginning. We spend a lot of time and energy working with brand new startups, incorporating them, helping them with their seed financing, their first rounds and so forth. It’s quite common we often meet with entrepreneurs sometimes before they’ve even decided to form a company.</p>
<p>SB: <em>What’s been your most thrilling deal?</em></p>
<p>IG: So I work with DoorDash and the way I met them was because I was volunteering for an investor friend who teaches a startup class at Stanford and at the end of his class there was a little panel discussion and several students in the class were the original founders of DoorDash. That’s how I met them!</p>
<p>SB: <em>You see all these deals. Have you ever wanted to create your own startup?</em></p>
<p>IG: (laughs) That’s the fun thing about Gunderson. This place is a startup, too.</p>
<p>SB: <em>Hmmm…</em></p>
<p>IG: But I have to tell you I have so much respect and admiration for startup founders. I guess I’m just not that bold. Everyone talks about the ones that succeed, but when you’re a startup lawyer you know that for every one of those there’s 10 or 15 that didn’t make it where people really gave their blood and their sweat and money.</p>
<p>SB: <em>Do you ever see a startup idea and just cringe? Like a really terrible idea?</em></p>
<p>IG: Yes!</p>
<p>SB: <em>Do you ever want to tell them to just not waste their time and money?</em></p>
<p>IG: Maybe it’s to my detriment but I’m okay with telling them that.</p>
<p>SB: <em>Okay. I’ll be honest — I didn’t think Twitter would be a thing and now here we are.</em></p>
<p>IG: That’s why I’m not a VC.</p>
<p>SB: <em>What happens when someone like me or someone on my team breaks a story and it’s a deal you are working on? What happens inside Gunderson Dettmer?</em></p>
<p>IG: There’s often a call that comes from someone in the company and they’re trying to figure out how did [the deal details] get out. And the market has become so sophisticated so often when we get the call we’ll say “hey, it’s because we filed something.” But a lot of firms have become a lot more thoughtful and careful about that sort of thing. But sometimes it’s hard to break the reality to people which is folks in this town love to chat.</p>
<p>SB:  <em>Yes, they do :)</em></p>
<p>IG: I’m blown away sometimes at the accuracy of the reports, whether it’s TechCrunch or some of the other sources. It’s like how did they know that? We just filed that last night!</p>
<p>SB: <em>Do you watch HBO’s Silicon Valley?</em></p>
<p>IG: I do! I love that show. You know what’s crazy about that show, and I’m sure you know this as a TechCrunch reporter but there’s no doubt in my mind a significant number of the story lines are lifted from actual events that have happened in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>SB: <em>I wouldn’t be surprised. So, what advice do you have for Pied Piper founder Richard Hendricks right now?</em></p>
<p><strong><em>(Caution, if you’re not caught up on this season, there is a slight spoiler ahead so don’t read if you don’t want to know anything about this season yet).</em></strong></p>
<p>IG: I haven’t caught up on the latest episode but the last time I was caught up he was leaving to start his new internet thing but he hadn’t actually done it.</p>
<p>SB: <em>Ya, you’re pretty much there.</em></p>
<p>IG: Well, if I were advising him the cool thing is he’s been through the wringer and now he’s not a first-time entrepreneur anymore so it’s like “hey, if there’s any way you can finance this thing and hold off on raising money for a longer period of time.” And I’m sure VC’s don’t like to hear that but the longer you can stay independent the more leverage you have.\\
\\
SB: <em>Well thanks for talking with me and offering your advice. By the way, if you feel like sending me any deals that just happened or that you know are going to happen, feel free. I’m on Signal.</em></p>
<p>IG: Uhhh, not one of our clients… but I’ll keep that in mind.</p>`;

<p>Have you ever wondered:</p>
<h2>Does the real <strong>Pied Piper</strong> idea from HBO’s Silicon Valley actually exist? </h2>
<p><strong>Yes, it does.</strong> It’s called SAFE network and it has a lot to do with the HBO show.</p>
<p>We got the exciting opportunity to talk with SAFE Network’s team about the project of creating a real-life decentralized web. Yes, you’ve heard that right – a team of developers are working on building the new network – just like the Pied Piper’s decentralized Internet featured on HBO’s show “Silicon Valley”.</p>
<p>Ge to know more about the project thanks to our interview with <em>Dimitar Dimitrov – part of SAFE Network’s team.</em></p>
<h2>Who is Dimitar Dimitrov from the SAFE Network?</h2>
<p>Dimitar Dimitrov believes in The Clean, Green, Immutable Dream  personified in the Safe Network. Before he discovered the world of cryptocurrencies, he worked in the telecommunications sector for 14 years and had a  small alternative telecom in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>At this point of his career, Dimitar Dimitrov has a boutique advertising agency. In his free time, he is  developing a charity project – <strong><a href="http://sofia.help/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sofia.Help</a></strong> for providing grants through advertising to various fundraising initiatives. The charity helps children with serious illnesses, street animals and others.</p>
<p><img src="https://egorithms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dimitar-Dimitrov-_-Safe-network.png" alt="The Real Pied Piper - SAFE Network: What is it?"></p>
<h2>What is SAFE Network and its purpose?</h2>
<p>The Safe Network is probably the longest project in development in the crypto world. It even precedes bitcoin and has been in the works since 2006.</p>
<p>Human history knows two events that have had a huge impact on our development – copying information (the printing press) and transporting information (the Internet).</p>
<blockquote><p>What the Safe Network aims to do is to create a technology that will allow the eternal storage of information.</p></blockquote>
<p>What makes “Safe” different?</p>
<p>In short,</p>
<blockquote><p>Safe is an autonomous decentralized Internet residing in the computers and smartphones of ordinary users.</p></blockquote>
<p>The data is distributed between devices without human intervention, while simultaneously being <strong>secure</strong>, <strong>anonymous</strong>, and <strong>censorship-resistant</strong>.</p>
<p>Safe covers all the current features of the Internet – website hosting, social networks, emails, chats, video platforms, payment systems – including things that we still find hard to imagine possible.</p>
<h2>When did you start developing the network &amp; How did you join the team? </h2>
<p>The project is open source and everyone is welcome to get involved in its development. It was started by <strong>David Irvine</strong> in 2006, and in 2014 received funding from an international community who believed that we could develop such technology.</p>
<p>My involvement in the project started as a member of the community. I am currently helping with the marketing of the project in the social networks and by popularizing the idea in Bulgaria as well, through an ad campaign with posters at the residential entrances in the capital and the big regional cities.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian Safe community is not large, but it is one of the most active. We help the project by developing and maintaining international sites and forums for Safe in different languages – German, Russian, French, Spanish.</p>`;

<p>If you are one of those visitors to Piedpiper.com, worry not, here are the recaps of the best content of the site, and background information with regard to data compression.</p>
<h2>The History of Piedpiper.com</h2>
<p>Piedpiper.com is the in-universe website for the fictional tech startup company Pied Pieper (PP) from HBO’s show Silicon Valley. The website is launched in 2014, featuring the introduction to the mock-up data compression algorithm – middle out, as well as company history, blogs and an introduction to team members.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.videoproc.com/images/vp-seo/piedpiper-headpic.jpg" alt="Pied Piper logos"></p>
<h4>What is Pied Piper in Silicon Valley?</h4>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the show, here is the background information. Pied Piper is the brainchild of Richard Hendricks, the protagonist of HBO’s show Silicon Valley. It was initially the name for Hendricks’ songwriter-oriented music app, a tool that helped artists to detect whether their work infringed fellow artists’ copyright.</p>
<p>Hendricks accidentally find out the compression algorithm used in Pied Piper has a better chance for monetization, as the high compression rate is highly demanded in the market.</p>
<h2>Evolution of Piedpiper.com (2014 till Now)</h2>
<p>Piedpiper.com had been keeping updating and growing alongside the plot of Silicon Valley, new blogs were added every now and then. Over the years, the website has revamped the interface and introduced new tech that was developed or envisioned in the TV series.</p>
<p>Since Piedpiper is down now, here is a recap of how the website look like over the years.</p>
<h4>Piedpiper.com in Year 1 (2014)</h4>
<p><img src="https://www.videoproc.com/images/vp-seo/piedpiper-2014-homescreen.jpg" alt="Pied Piper Home Page in 2014"></p>
<p>During the first year, the website features mainly the Pied Piper compression technology, the crew members, and how the startup came into being from a music-copyright detection service to media compression.</p>
<p>Richard Hendriks, the founder of Pied Piper, stated that the compression cloud solution brings them “a clearer path to monetization”, and that they hope to “make the world a better place through compression services”.</p>

<p>The second 2 witness the emphasis on the “middle-out” compression algorithm developed by Hendriks. The top banner of the homepage features the double P logo of Pied Piper, with a tagline “A Middle-Out Compression Solution Making Data Storage Problems Smaller”.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.videoproc.com/images/vp-seo/piedpiper-2015-ui-tech.jpg" alt="CapCut Online Team Projects"></p>
<p>It was immediately followed by detailed explanation to Pied Piper SaaS. It claims that built-in universal compression engines can handle any file, data, video or image of all sizes.</p>

<p>In 2016, Piedpiper changes its logo from the PP design to the hat as the synecdoche of the fairy tale character. It also features the interface of the Pied Piper compression tool for the first time.</p>
<p>When it comes to the algorithm, the website stated that middle-out can “find long-range structure in your files to create the most efficient encoding of your data”. It doesn’t offer more information or illustration on that “long-range” thing.</p>

<p>For the next two years, Pied Piper embarks on new frontier: from data compression to decentralized internet. It is still consistent with how the company was doing initially, with universal compression to power up the peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage. The team brand it as the PiperNet.</p>
<p>Since then, there is not big updated to the website until it is down for good recently.</p>
<h2>Why It is Called Pied Piper</h2>
<p>Pied Piper was initially adopted by Hendricks to name his music site, an online tool that allows musicians and songwriters to check for plagiarism. The program and the name itself was laughed at by his fellow programmers, who only later to discover the algorithm that involves compression worth billions than the music-checking service.</p>
<p>From then on, the fictional brand Pied Piper sticks, but then it refers to the tech startup and its SaaS services, mainly focused on data compression, and later also involved in decentralized internet.</p>
<p>There are theories that it is thus called because of the idiom “who pays the piper gets to call the tune”, which means people who pays for something has the right to control the situation and make decisions.</p>
<p>Still, in the show, the fictional SEO Hendricks didn’t explain why he want to name his project as Pied Piper. The expression itself shares profound cultural bearings, which probably all starts with legend: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pied Piper of Hamelin</a>.</p>
<h4>Pied Piper of Hamelin</h4>
<p>Pied Piper of Hamelin is a German legend from a town named Hamelin, located on the river Weser in Lower Saxony, Germany. The legend depicts a piper, dressed in multicolored cloth, lured 130 children away from the town by playing his magic pipe.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pied here refers to two or multiple colors, and that’s how that Piper was dressed like. It was initially used to refer to the black-and-white magpie, and later evolved to indicate anything that are colorfully jumbled.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Pied Piper was original hired by citizens from that town to help them get rid of rats. All his effort was in vain when the town folks refuse to pay. Irritated and furious, the rat-catcher started to play hypnotic notes that lured all the children in Hamlin. They followed Pied Piper out of the town, and never came back.</p>
<p>There are theories that the legend was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200902-the-grim-truth-behind-the-pied-piper" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">based on historical events</a>, as BBC observes, a grim truth.</p>
<p>The legend is then adapted into art works, literature, music, film and TV series.</p>
<h5>Pied Piper in Linguistics: Pied-Piping</h5>
<p>In Linguistics, the legendary Pier Piper’s nature of attracting others was borrowed to describe a phenomenon in Syntax: a Wh- word can drag its containing phrase to move along with it, when it is put to the front of the clause.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.videoproc.com/images/vp-seo/pied-piping-syntax.jpg" alt="Pied Piping in Syntax"></p>
<p>This phenomenon is called Pied-piping, in a way that metaphorically compares Wh- word to the Pied Piper that lures the phrase away with it.</p>
<h2>Pied Piper Interface and Its Mock-Ups</h2>
<p>Here is the fictional home page of Pied Piper, to which the official twitter account of Dropbox has <a href="https://twitter.com/dropbox/status/739645743862931456" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered its congratulations</a>.</p>

The screenshot was originally hosted <a href="http://www.piedpiper.com/app/themes/pied-piper/dist/images/interface_large.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, but it is no longer accessible along with nixing of the domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.videoproc.com/images/vp-seo/piedpiper-web-mockup.jpg" alt="Pied Piper Web Mockup"></p>
<p>The UI/UX design of the compression tool triggered <a href="https://www.videoproc.com/resource/what-happened-to-piedpiper.htm#:~:text=The%20UI/UX%20design%20of%20the%20compression%20tool%20triggered%20valuable%20discussions%20from%20fans%20who%20are%20UX%20designers%2C%20product%20managers%2C%20developers%20and%20people%20from%20other%20related%20segments." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">valuable discussions</a> from fans who are UX designers, product managers, developers and people from other related segments.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.videoproc.com/images/vp-seo/piedpiper-compression-interface.jpg" alt="Pied Piper Compression Tool Interface"></p>
<p>Most UX designers would agree that the interface will be intimidating for general users, and that the layout and parameters seemed too “engineered” for non-techie persons to proceed. They suggest to keep only the file type and format, the Let’s Go button, and couple of easy-to-understand options, while moving other parameters under an “Advanced” button.</p>
<p>Following these interesting discussions, there are mockups of the official mockups – pun intended.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.videoproc.com/images/vp-seo/piedpiper-redesign-niteeshyadav.jpg" alt="Pied Piper Redesign"></p>
<p>Above is the reimagined design of Piped Piper by <a href="https://dribbble.com/niteeshyadav" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Niteesh Yadav</a>, a London based designer. It adds sidebars to streamline the workflow, with visual signs that better demonstrate the storage saved and the current speed.</p>

<h2>Data Compression in Pied Pieper and Beyond</h2>
<p>The first turning point in Silicon Valley occurred when Hendriks accidentally discovered the importance of data compression. In real life, we can never stress enough the significance of data compression, be it online streaming or for archiving purposes.</p>
<h4>Compression in the Story: Middle-Out Algorithm and Weissman Score</h4>
<p>Is Middle-Out algorithm real? For anyone having an interest in data compression, this hyper-realistic detail in Silicon Valley is enchanting. However, the algorithm and its high compression rate are yet a reality in everyday life.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.videoproc.com/images/vp-seo/weissman-score.jpg" alt="Weissman SCORE"></p>
<p>The good news is, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weissman_score" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Weissman Score</a> depicted in the show moves to reality. This <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-madefortv-compression-algorithm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made-for-TV-algorithm</a> was applied to assess the compression performance. It compared the compression ratio and processing time with existing applications, so as to evaluate the performance of the application in question.</p>
<p>Profession Weissman and Doctor Misra are the brains behind Weissman when requested by Silicon Valley’s creator Mike Judge.</p>
<h4>Compression in Real World</h4>
<p>In real world, data compression in general refers to the process to reduce the bits used in multimedia, such as videos, images, audio and other files according to Wikipedia. For instance, a 4K video may have a bitrate of 36 Mbps, while a 720p SD video merely has 5 Mbps.</p>
<p>With a more efficient encoding algorithm, media file size can be reduced significantly, with or without perceivable quality loss. For instance, HEVC H265 is claimed to save up to 50% compared to H264 compression. The key improvements accounting for the efficiency are related to block size, block partitioning structure, parallel tool, frame prediction, and sample adaptive offset.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.videoproc.com/images/vp-seo/hevc-vs-h264-blocks.jpg" alt="HEVC VS H.264 Blocks"></p>
<p>Here are some of the popular <a href="https://www.videoproc.com/video-editor/best-video-compressor.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video compressors</a>:</p>
<p><strong>FFmpeg:</strong> It is a command line based, free open-source tool for video and audio compressing, transcoding, and simple editing. Users need to be familiar with <a href="https://www.videoproc.com/resource/ffmpeg-commands.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FFmpeg commands</a> to get the work done.</p>
<p><strong>Handbrake:</strong> It offers a GUI over FFmpeg, so that users unfamiliar with command line tools can feel at home. It uses the RF value for quality control when adjusting the bitrate. There are options to enable 2-Pass encoding and Turbo first pass.</p>
<p><strong>Shutter Encoder:</strong> It was the brainchild of passionate video editors to streamline the production. Users can tweak with multiple parameters to achieve desired bitrate. It includes the support for the latest codec such as VP9, AV1, and H265 that are efficient in video compression.</p>
<p>Being a popular TV series, the Pied Piper metaphor is quite popular among tech publications. SaaS and platforms that offer compression services are often compared as the real life Pied Piper. There are also Pied-Piper-inspired projects.</p>
<p><strong>Piper Pied (Discontinued):</strong> It is a creative spin of Peter Ma and Nancy Ghaly, the brother and sister team that claims to develop a lossless image compression algorithm. They take it to the Hackathon, and built a site for it. As of 2022, the website is shut down.</p>
<p><strong>Terark’s Pied Piper of Database:</strong> The algorithm can save database space by compressing data, while making it still searchable. It is developed by Terark’s CTO Lei Peng, and has won a $1 million contract from Alibaba for its Cloud service.</p>`;

<p>“I was thinking, actually, what if you had asked for less?” Pied Piper’s Richard Hendricks asks a fictional founder in a bar scene in the season 2 premiere of HBO’s Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The other founder, Javeed, of “Googlibib,” reflects. “It might have been easier to hit more benchmarks… we wouldn’t have faced that down round.” Growing increasingly despondent and loud, he continues, “We wouldn’t have had to settle for acquisition… We could have done a legit series B… I’d still be CEO… I’d probably still have my girlfriend… Why the f*** didn’t anyone tell me I could take less?”</p>
<p>It plays pretty funny on the screen, but this fictional interchange illustrates a very real challenge entrepreneurs face: Money doesn’t necessarily mean freedom. Yet the ability to maneuver in response to business challenges is the one thing a startup founder needs most. Some of these decisions are minor: Should we give an early customer a big discount in order to close the deal? Others are existential: Is it time to sell the company?</p>
<p>As grueling as it can be to make a call on the hard decisions, it’s much worse to be unable to make a key decision at all — to be forced to take an action due to financial restrictions or other constraints.</p>
<p>When you’re building a company, you need to maximize your degrees of freedom — you need to have the widest set of options available to you for key strategic decisions.</p>
<p>Conventional (and even fictional!) startup wisdom says that the best way to maintain your degrees of freedom is to raise more money than you need so that you have a large war chest of capital on hand. I’m here to tell you that, based on my experience working with hundreds of startups, that one of the best ways to improve your optionality is to ignore that conventional wisdom and instead stay extremely efficient in both your operations and your fundraising strategy. You can actually increase your degrees of freedom not only by not spending money you have, but by not having too much to begin with. The best move for many startups is to raise just enough money to achieve key milestones.</p>
<p>We call this “just-enough” approach the capital-efficient path. Companies that follow this practice maintain tight, resourceful operations throughout their early stages and only add capital when there are proof points and processes to support it. The resourcefulness required of capital efficiency can dramatically improve your odds of building a successful startup.</p>
<p>In fact, capital-efficient founders can enable heroic success for themselves and their companies, while at the same time lowering the risk of startup failure.</p>
<p>Let’s explore why having just enough funding is actually better for your business.</p>
<h2>Capital efficiency and optionality</h2>
<p>The “less is more” approach seems counter-intuitive to many new entrepreneurs. But it is the path that many, many successful companies have taken, and, from the perspective of founders, it is arguably a less-risky path to success than the path of raising large amounts of venture capital.</p>
<p>Why? Because it lets you keep your options open. Here’s how:</p>
<h4>You can choose how to grow your company</h4>
<p>More companies die of drowning in opportunities than of starvation. Focusing your company on a very specific target market, finding a way to dominate that constrained market and then expanding from there is a well-documented approach to significantly reducing the risk of a startup’s failure.</p>
<p>But companies that raise a lot of money are often priced out of that model. They need to grow their top line at all costs, and one of the non-obvious costs can be losing the discipline of focus. When you choose to stay capital efficient, you can choose less-risky, more-focused paths, while still retaining the optionality to go much bigger once your product and sales repeatability are well-established.</p>
<p>Even Amazon — which has a market cap on the order of $400 billion — raised only $8 million of venture capital money as a private company before going public. It started with a very limited model of selling just books before it expanded to become the Everything Store.</p>
<h4>You can weather storms</h4>
<p>But, you say, what about market downturns? What if it becomes harder to raise money? Won’t a big cache of cash ensure survivability through hard times?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. The single largest determinant of whether you can survive a downturn in the funding market is your burn rate. You can weather storms better if you are capital efficient. If your cash burn is low — or even better, if you can get to cash-flow break-even — you can get through hard times.</p>
<p>But if your burn rate is high, even a significant pile of cash won’t save you unless you are ready to make tough, morale-crushing decisions blindingly fast — such as laying off a large portion of your workforce or abandoning whole sectors of your business. And the unfortunate truth is that the bigger your cash reserves are, the higher your cash burn rate is likely to be.</p>
<p>Keep this mantra in mind: less burn, more options.</p>
<h4>You can choose your exit strategy</h4>
<p>Choosing an exit path is the greatest startup existential question of all. It’s also where raising too much capital limits your optionality the most. Venture capitalists don’t like to talk about this — shooting for the moon is expected.</p>
<p>But most exits are not billion-dollar IPOs or even $200 million acquisitions. Raising big money — even at a very high valuation, in fact especially at a very high valuation — forces you to a big exit.</p>
<p>If you don’t make that exit bogey, the portfolio effect might force you into an uncomfortable position: Venture capitalists aiming for a 10x return can torpedo smaller exits in pursuit of a “go-big-or-go-home” approach. Investors have a portfolio to manage, but you do not: You’re all-in on this hand. You can limit the risk of misaligned interests, and increase your flexibility, by raising only the money you need and managing the post-money valuation to better balance dilution against upside.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more room available to make everyone happy, founders and investors alike, if the last round’s post-money valuation is $25 million versus $250 million. In the latter case, your investors are likely to expect you to hit a billion dollars — or die trying.</p>
<p>Everyone wants a gigantic success and a big exit. But taking excess capital to achieve that outcome leads to a brittle, inflexible company. There is such a thing as too much money.</p>
<p>To keep your company open to multiple kinds of success, you need to decisively govern the amount and character of the money coming in. You might still end up growing a unicorn (like Atlassian did, with its $0 in venture funding on its cap table). But if a unicorn is not in the cards, the decision of where to drive your company is much more likely to remain in your hands, and the return you’ll get is more likely to be something with which you’ll be happy.</p>
<p>Capital efficiency can help create better optionality for your startup. Furthermore, the constraints of capital efficiency can actually help your company grow in a rapid, healthy, controllable way.</p>`;

Like, let’s not turn this into a corporate cult with bike meetings and voluntary retreats that are actually mandatory and claiming for the world to be a better place all the time.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Let’s just think different. Don’t ‘think different,’ that’s Apple.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“I always knew I was missing something, and then when someone explained the concept of ‘game’ I remember very distinctly thinking ‘That’s what I don’t have.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“I’m okay as long as I don’t think about it.”</p></blockquote>`;
