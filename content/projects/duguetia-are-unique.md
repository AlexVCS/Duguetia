description: The fruits of the Duguetia species are unlike almost all other fruits, bearing closest resemblance to those of the Annona genus which claims many more famous, delicious and widely cultivated fruit such as the cherimoya (A. cherimola), soursop (A. muricata), sugar apple (A. squamosa), custard apple (A. reticulata). The likeness is obvious, but the Duguetia species posses a unique aesthetic that is distinctly their own.  They seem to represent a link between Annona and their distant cousins, Magnolia, as the Annonaceae family falls within the Order Magnoliales. This entire ancient group of plants arose before bees and other related pollinators - their chief means of pollination being through early beetles. The unique architecture of the fruits from these plants (Magnolia, Annona and Duguetia) showcase a shared ancient iteration of plant structures that is unique from other more modern plant groups.
